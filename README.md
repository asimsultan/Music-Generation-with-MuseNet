# Music Generation with MuseNet

Welcome to the Music Generation with MuseNet project! This project focuses on generating music using the MuseNet model.

## Introduction

Music generation involves creating musical sequences based on the context provided. In this project, we leverage the power of MuseNet to generate music using a dataset of MIDI files.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of MIDI files. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/midi_files` directory.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenAI MuseNet
- MIDIUtil

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/musenet_music_generation.git
cd musenet_music_generation

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes MIDI files. Place these files in the data/ directory.

# To fine-tune the MuseNet model for music generation, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/midi_files

# To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model and generate new music, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/ --data_path data/midi_files --output_path generated_music
